name: Prepare dotnet outputs

#
# This action is called from:
#  - the 'dotnet-solution-ci.yml' file IF the workflow parameter PREPARE_OUTPUTS is set to 'true'.
#  - the 'dotnet-solution-ci-build.yml' file.
#
# Prepared outputs will be zipped and uploaded as the 'dotnet' artifact.
#
# All 'apps' must be output into the '/functions\' subfolder, to match
# how they are later retrieved in the '<domain>-stage-deployment.yml' file.
