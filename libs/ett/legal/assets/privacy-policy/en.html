  <section id="purpose">
    <h2>Purpose of processing personal data</h2>
    <p>
      When we process information about you in Energy Track & Trace DK, it is for the purpose of
      giving you access to your own data. Additionally, Energy Track & Trace DK also serves the
      purpose of providing you as a producer or consumer with access to the issuance and use of
      granular certificates to document that the electricity is green at the time it is used.
      Furthermore, you have the option to grant powers of attorney to so-called third parties, such
      as energy advisors, brokers, or other market participants, who can act on your behalf
      regarding the issuance and use of granular certificates.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="legal-basis">
    <h2>Legal basis for the processing of personal data</h2>
    <p>
      Energinet DataHub only processes your personal data to the extent necessary to fulfill the
      above purposes and only in accordance with applicable law. The legal basis for processing your
      information in Energy Track & Trace DK is Article 6(1)(b) of the General Data Protection
      Regulation (GDPR). The processing of personal data in Energy Track & Trace DK is therefore
      necessary for the performance of a contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not use automated decision-making, including profiling, as part of our processing of
      personal data.

            Data is deleted after 3 + 5 years<br /><br />
            Data in Energy Track and Trace is calculated based on data from the DataHub system,
            which is covered by the provision in the Accounting Act § 10. Therefore, certificate
            data must be stored for 5 years from the end of the financial year to which the material
            relates.<br /><br />
            Since data in the DataHub system can be corrected over a 3-year period, certificate data
            is therefore only deleted 5 years after the last correction has been made.

    <p>
      Once you have requested access to the personal data, we have registered about you, to have it
      corrected or deleted, or if you have objected to our data processing, we will investigate
      whether it is possible to accommodate your request. We will respond to your inquiry as soon as
      possible and no later than one month after we have received your inquiry.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Right of access</strong><br />
        You have the right to access the information we process about you.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Right to rectification</strong><br />
        If you believe that the personal data we process about you is inaccurate, you have the right

        should be corrected to.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Right to erasure or "the right to be forgotten"</strong><br />
        We delete personal data when it is no longer necessary to retain it. In special cases, you
        have the right to have specific information about you deleted before our regular deletion
        occurs. If you no longer wish to be registered in Energy Track & Trace DK, you can delete
        your information at any time via Energy-trackandtrace.dk, provided it is not required to be
        retained by law.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Right to restriction of processing</strong><br />
        If you disagree with the information we have registered or otherwise process, you can
        request that we restrict the processing of the information until we have had the opportunity
        to determine whether the information is correct. You can also request restriction instead of
        deletion if you believe our processing of the information is unlawful, or if you believe we
        no longer need the information, or if you believe that your legitimate interests outweigh
        Energinet's legitimate interests as the data controller.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Right to data portability</strong><br />
        You have the right, in certain cases, to receive your personal data and to request that the

      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Right to object</strong><br />
        You have the right to object to our processing of information about you. If your objection
        is justified, we will ensure that the processing of the information ceases.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Right to complain</strong><br />
        If you are not satisfied with our response, you can complain to the Data Protection Agency.
        Generally, if you are dissatisfied with the way your personal data has been handled, you can
        complain to the Data Protection Agency, which will then investigate the matter and make a
        decision. You can find the contact details of the Data Protection Agency at
