## Stack

The `vater-stack` layout component is a simple element designed to create stack-based layouts
with ease. It allows you to arrange child elements vertically (in a column) or horizontally
(in a row) within a container. If the dimensions of the child elements surpass the container's
width (or height, depending on the stacking direction), they will shrink when possible or otherwise
overflow to fit the available space. They will never expand beyond their original dimensions.

<!-- Horizontally align two buttons with a small gap -->
<vater-stack direction="row" gap="s">
  <watt-button>Ok</watt-button>
  <watt-button>Close</watt-button>
</vater-stack>
  `}
/>


## Flex

Next layout component is `vater-flex`, meant to simplify the creation of flexible layouts.
Like the `vater-stack` component, it provides the ability to arrange child elements vertically
(column) or horizontally (row). What makes `vater-flex` distinct is its ability to stretch
child elements along the flex direction. Additionally, the component offers a `scrollable` input,
allowing the container to shrink beyond the minimum height while showing a scrollbar.

  code={`
<!-- Button on top with a card stretched to fill the remaining height -->
<vater-flex gap="m">
  <watt-button>Log out</watt-button>
  <watt-card vater fill="vertical">
    <h3>Heading</h3>
    <p>Content</p>
  </watt-card>
</vater-flex>
  `}
/>


## Spacer

The `VaterSpacerComponent` serves as a handy tool for improving the flexibility of layouts when
utilized in conjunction with the `vater-flex` component. It provides a straightforward method for
inserting space between items, enabling you to easily fine-tune the alignment of your content.

<Story of={VaterStories.Spacer} />
<Source
  language='html'
  dark={true}
  code={`
<!-- Container with a left aligned title and a right aligned log out button -->
<vater-flex>
  <h1>Dashboard</h1>
  <vater-spacer />
  <watt-button>Log out</watt-button>
</vater-flex>
  `}
/>


## Utility

The `VaterUtilityDirective` simplifies class assignment by offering an intuitive, effortless,
and inherently type-safe mechanism for applying utility classes. This not only streamlines
development but also enhances the development experience by enabling editor auto-completion
for CSS utilities.

<Source
  language='html'
  dark={true}
  code={`
<!-- Card positioned to fill the entire view minus a medium margin -->
<watt-card vater inset="m">
  <!-- The fill utility is available on vater-flex and vater-stack by default -->
  <vater-flex fill="horizontal">
    <h1>Results</h1>
    <vater-spacer />
    <watt-search label="Search" />
  </vater-flex>
  <watt-table />
</watt-card>
  `}
/>
