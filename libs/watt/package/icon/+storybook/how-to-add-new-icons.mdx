# How to add new icons

If you need to add a new icon to the design system, you should follow this guide:

## Material icons

For icons that can be found in the material symbol library, you can follow these steps:

1. Add the icon to the `WattIconMap` in `libs\watt\package\icon\icons.ts`
2. Add the icon to an icon group in `libs\watt\package\icon\+storybook\storybook-icon-overview.component.ts`

## Custom icons

When adding custom icons that are not part of the material symbol library, you can create a custom
component instead. Example:

```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'watt-custom-icon',
  imports: [WattIconComponent],
  template: `
    <watt-icon>
      <svg viewBox="0 0 640 480">
        <path fill="red" d="M0 160h640v160H0z" />
      </svg>
    </watt-icon>
  `,
})
export class WattCustomIconComponent {}
```
