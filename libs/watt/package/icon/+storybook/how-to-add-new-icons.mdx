# How to add new icons

If you need to add a new icon to the design system, you should follow this guide.

### New interface essentials (MATERIAL ICONS)

1. Add the icon to `materialIcons` in `libs\watt\src\lib\foundations\icon\icons.ts`
2. Add the icon to an icon group in `libs\watt\src\lib\foundations\icon\+storybook\storybook-icon-overview.component.ts`

### New Watt icon (CUSTOM ICON)

1. Add the icon to `customIcons` in `libs\watt\src\lib\foundations\icon\icons.ts`
2. Place your svg in `libs\watt\src\assets\icons`
3. Make sure the svg doesn't have any hardcoded colors, if so replace these with `currentColor`
4. Add the icon to the custom icons (Watt Icons) in `libs\watt\src\lib\foundations\icon\+storybook\storybook-icon-overview.component.html`
