  <h2 class="watt-space-stack-m">Welcome to the beta test of Energy Track And Trace</h2>
  <h4 class="watt-space-stack-m">Notice of change:</h4>
  <p class="watt-space-stack-m">
    Due to changes in the solution regarding certificates, some data has been removed or is planned
    to be removed. <br />
    This means that metering points that have been activated for issuance of certificates before
    <b>August 17th, 2023</b>, must be re-activated. Furthermore, certificates that have been issued
    before <b>August 23rd, 2023</b>, will be removed. <br />
    <br />
    This page is based on real data and is working towards the coming solution regarding
    certificates. So it is not just a test, though these data cannot yet be used in a legal sense.
    It will be communicated, when it is out of beta and can be used legally. So you can try this
    without any consequences.
