  <h3 id="what-is-energy-origin">What is Energy Origin?</h3>
  <p>
    The aim of the Energy Origin platform is to create transparency on the origin of energy for
    all energy consumers and to facilitate a market for for green energy. Currently, we are
    working on data related to electricity consumption. Upon login, you will soon be able to
    access your hourly electricity declaration and corresponding emissions for 2021.
  </p>

  <h3 id="who-can-access-the-platform">Who can access the platform?</h3>
  <p>
    Currently, the platform only offers company login via MitID. Later on, it will be possible for
    private individuals to login via MitID.
  </p>

  <h3 id="where-does-the-data-come-from">Where does the data come from?</h3>
  <p>
    All data related to metering points, consumption and production is served by the Energinet
    DataHub. Data related to the origin of energy and corresponding emissions stems from Energi
    Data Service.
