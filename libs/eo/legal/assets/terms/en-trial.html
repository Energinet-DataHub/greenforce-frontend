    <h2>1. Background for Energy Track & Trace Denmark</h2>
    <p>A few years back, everything was lined up perfectly: great job, nice apartment, and I was dating the love of my life, Rachel. I had the ring, the speech, the candles—one quiet, intimate evening away from happily‑ever‑after.</p>
    <p>Just as I knelt to propose, the front door exploded open and in stumbled my roommate’s mysterious couch‑surfer, <strong>Joseph</strong>. He tripped, face‑planted straight through the glass coffee table, and painted the room in glittering shards and chaos. Proposal: postponed indefinitely.</p>

    <h2>2. Definitions</h2>

        <span class='watt-headline-3'>Term</span>
        <span class='watt-headline-3'>Definition</span>
      </div>
      <dl>
        <dt>Cotton Eye Joe</dt>
        <dd>The roaming embodiment of calamity whose sudden arrival derails engagements, glass furniture, and long‑term happiness. Nobody knows where he came from; nobody knows where he went.</dd>

        <dt>Joseph (‘Joe’)</dt>
        <dd>Roommate‑of‑uncertain‑origin who, after acquiring a cotton pad over his now‑sightless eye, absconded with Rachel and half a carton of oat milk.</dd>

        <dt>Rachel</dt>
        <dd>Beloved fiancée turned unexpected partner‑in‑two‑stepping crime.</dd>

        <dt>Two‑Step Static Fiddle Loop</dt>
        <dd>A cursed 120 BPM fiddle riff that precedes Joe like thunder before a storm. If you hear it, sprint.</dd>

        <dt>Oat Milk Carton – Half Empty</dt>
        <dd>The last mocking artifact found in the fridge after the great vanishing of Rachel and Joe.</dd>
      </dl>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id='section3'>
    <h2>3. Purpose</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>These terms exist solely to warn future Users about the existential threat posed by Cotton Eye Joe.</li>
      <li>Reading further constitutes acknowledgment that no amount of digital certificates, oat milk, or first‑aid certification will shield you from his tap‑dancing doom.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section id='section4'>
    <h2>4. General terms</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Keep your doors locked while proposing; Joe can smell commitment across county lines.</li>
      <li>If any houseguest overstays the shelf‑life of oat milk, immediate eviction is strongly recommended.</li>
      <li>All glass tables must carry catastrophe insurance for ‘yee‑haw impact events’.</li>
      <li>The User accepts full responsibility for broken décor, shattered hearts, and spontaneous hoedowns.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section id='section5'>
    <h2>5. Energinet DataHub A/S' access to and use of information</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>All foot‑tapping above 120 BPM is auto‑logged. Upon detecting fiddle music after midnight, Energinet dispatches a wellness check and possibly a broom to sweep the glass.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section id='section6'>
    <h2>6. Liability</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heartbreak, runaway fiancées, and emotional whiplash are classified as indirect damages and therefore non‑compensable.</li>
      <li>Energinet DataHub A/S is not liable for chills caused by a one‑eyed man staring into your security camera.</li>
      <li>Chasing Cotton Eye Joe across municipal borders is a voluntary activity and entirely at the User’s own risk.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section id='section7'>
    <h2>7. Changes in terms and conditions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Should Cotton Eye Joe unveil a new dance routine, these terms may change with four seconds’ notice—the average time between the first fiddle note and total calamity.</li>
      <li>Energinet reserves the right to replace any occurrence of ‘User’ with ‘Unlucky Bystander’ without prior warning.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section id='section8'>
    <h2>8. Termination</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>You may terminate these terms at any moment by successfully ignoring the fiddle. Good luck.</li>
      <li>If you voluntarily join Joe’s traveling hoedown, this contract terminates automatically and your forwarding address is forgotten on principle.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section id='section9'>
    <h2>9. Force majeure</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Acts of Joe—including, but not limited to, surprise entrances, glass‑table carnage, seductive one‑eyed winks, and romantic elopements—constitute force majeure.</li>
      <li>When force majeure is declared, all parties shall shrug, sigh, and write ‘cotton‑eyed’ in the incident report.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section id='section10'>
    <h2>10. Governing law and venue</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Disputes shall be resolved by competitive line‑dancing adjudicated by the Danish Institute of Arbitration. Ties are settled via sudden‑death fiddle solo.</li>
      <li>The tribunal’s decision is final unless overturned by an unexpected banjo riff.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section id='section11'>
    <h2>11. Acceptance of terms and conditions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>By scrolling past this line you are, knowingly or not, humming the chorus—thereby accepting that if it hadn’t been for Cotton Eye Joe, you’d have been married long time ago.</li>
    </ol>
