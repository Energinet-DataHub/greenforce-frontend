# Project targets

`e2e` target configurations using a `development` application configuration will
load the `ett-api-environment.local.json` configuration file which can be
configured to target a feature environment.

`e2e` target configurations using a `production` application configuration will
load the `ett-api-environment.json` configuration file which targets local/same
environment `/api` endpoints which we stub using Cypress interceptors for now.
